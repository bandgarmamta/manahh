Over the past few weeks, you have noticed that the response time provided by the Business Support team is regularly affected by issues with their current system. You think that the current system could be improved with fresh ideas that could make a big difference. However, you are still new to the organization and are not as familiar with the details of the current system and how long these issues have been around. You are aware it will take some time to get familiar with the system. You approach one of your colleagues to speak about this matter and they explain that they have tried to solve these issues before, but due to the complexity of the system, there is not much that can be done.
